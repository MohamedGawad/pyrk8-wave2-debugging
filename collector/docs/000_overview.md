Collector is an application developed to assist with enablement and training.  The user interface is browser based and provides two personas, instructor and student.  Leading browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge have been used and should provide the expected user experience.

The student and instructor personas are provided with a core set of common capabilities.  A collection of menu options group the actions the user persona is able to perform.  The instructor persona is provided with additional capabilities that assist with course creation, validation, printing, publishing, etc.  The instructor is also provided with an additional tab in the main user interface.  This tab provides usage insights of student interaction. 

The initial packaging of Collector includes example courses.  These courses can be used to explore the capabilities of the Collector application.  These courses are also excellent starting points for creating your own courses.
